# The Wedding Greeting Project

They say that well-written computer programs are like poetry.
Here is proof that the reverse is not always true.

# Instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aharrison24/wedding-greeting

cd wedding-greeting
cmake .
make

./wedding_greeting
```

Once you have run the program, please feel free to do a code review for me.
